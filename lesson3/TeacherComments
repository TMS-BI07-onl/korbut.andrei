Well done!

a)
Technically, while writing second and third condition for this task you could leave only <100 and <500, because all conditions is being checked in the written order. It's just for your information. :)
Also, you missprinted third condition.

Correct answer:
SELECT DISTINCT Name
FROM Purchasing.Vendor v 
		LEFT JOIN Purchasing.ProductVendor pv ON v.BusinessEntityID=pv.BusinessEntityID
WHERE pv.BusinessEntityID IS NULL
Pay attention to required columns in the select list.
Also, Date can be NULL just by the data rules. That's why better way is to use id.

Correct answers:
SELECT Название
FROM Фирмы-производители 
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT преп.id_фирмы
				FROM Фармпрепараты преп
						JOIN Продажи прод ON преп.id=прод.id_фармпрепарата
						JOIN Кассовые_чеки чек ON прод.id_чека=чек.id 
				WHERE YEAR(Дата)=2019)
--=
SELECT преп.id_фирмы
FROM Фирмы-производители фирма 
	JOIN Фармпрепараты преп ON фирма.id=преп.id_фирмы
	JOIN Продажи прод ON преп.id=прод.id_фармпрепарата
	LEFT JOIN Кассовые_чеки чек ON прод.id_чека=чек.id 
WHERE YEAR(Дата)=2019 AND чек.id IS NULL
Your solution is not correct, because it will show all producers that have sales in other years. But that doesn't mean that these producers didn't have sales in the 2019.

Correct answer:
SELECT 2*Цена AS Новая_цена
FROM Фармпрепараты преп
	JOIN Типы_фармпрепаратов тип ON тип.id=преп.id_типа
WHERE Тип='А'
'A' is not type_id, it's type_name. You needed to join to types table.

c)
It would be better not to base count on the name. Name could include null. You can use id (because it's pk) or 1.
How could this task be correct with types if previous is with mistake?

WHERE can't be placed in the middle of the FROM!
