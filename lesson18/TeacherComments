Well done!

1.-1
In your solution you're grouping by employees name, not by managers.
Correct answer:
SELECT man.first_name, man.cast_name, COUNT(emp.employee_id) as cnt_of_emp
FROM employees man JOIN employees emp ON man.employee_id=emp.manager_id
GROUP BY man.first_name, man.cast_name
HAVING COUNT(emp.employee_id)>6

What is the need to use window functions?
Also you calculated the value of comission, you need to divide it from the salary.

3.
Second solution won't work. You don't have group by in the second subquery.

4. 
Some problems with calculating percentage. :)
... (AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id)/AVG(salary) OVER ())*100 AS diff_pct...

5. -1.5
You have the whole job_history table for this purpose.
